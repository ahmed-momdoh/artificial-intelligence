         <p><span id="u559">Artificial intelligence today is divided into four basic types, which are very similar to Maslow's hierarchy of basic needs, as the simplest types of artificial intelligence can only perform basic functions, while the more advanced types are a fully conscious entity of itself and what is going on around it, similar to To a large extent human consciousness. These four types are as follows: Reactive Machines. Limited Memory. Theory of Mind. Self Aware Today we have passed the stage of the first type of, and we are on the verge of mastering and professionalizing the second type, but the third and fourth types of artificial intelligence exist only as a theory, and they will most likely represent the next stage of the development of artificial intelligence. Let's take a closer look at these four types and what they mean .</span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span id="u559-4">1-Reactive Machines Reactive machines perform only basic tasks, and this type of artificial intelligence is the simplest of all. Machines that use this type respond to some inputs with some outputs and their working mechanism does not involve any self-learning process. We can say that it is the first stage of artificial intelligence, and examples of it are simple devices that recognize the face, for example. Or DeepBlue, a computer that beats the world chess champion .</span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span id="u559-7">2- Limited Memory In this type, artificial intelligence has the ability to store data or past predictions and use it to make better predictions in the future. With limited memory, engineering and building machine learning techniques becomes more complex. Examples of machines that use this type of artificial intelligence are self-driving cars, which store various data about the condition of the roads, other cars on the road and other factors, and based on this data make decisions about the route to take or the specific reaction to take. It is worth noting that most of today's AI-powered devices use limited memory, including personal assistance applications such as Google Assistance, voice and image recognition software, chatbots and others.</span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span id="u559-10">3- Theory of Mind While there are many machines that use previous types of artificial intelligence, this type is still only a theoretical idea, or a project that is still being developed. We can say that Theory of Mind is the next stage of artificial intelligence systems that scientists are currently working on creating and developing. In this type, the machine (thanks to artificial intelligence technology) will be able to understand the entities it interacts with, know their needs, feelings, principles, and even their thought process. In order to understand the difference between this type and its predecessor, let's imagine that you are driving to an important meeting but the traffic is so suffocating that you lose your nerve. You might yell and ask Google Maps to search for a shortcut, but this app won't give you any moral support, like, &quot;This is the fastest way we can go. Do you want me to call someone to apologize or postpone the meeting for a while?&quot; Google Maps will continue to show the same results based on the road reports and data it has. But using theory of mind technology, this app will be a better companion for you, it will understand your feelings, thoughts and help you feel better, which is now being developed and worked on within the field of Artificial Emotional Intelligence .</span></p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p><span id="u559-13">4- Self Awareness Finally, in an unknown distant future, humans may finally be able to develop artificial intelligence that is self-aware. It is the same entity we see in science fiction films. This kind of AI may raise a lot of hopes, but it also raises a lot of fears. The idea of a self-aware robot with its own intelligence and independence is troubling, because it means that humans then have to negotiate with the machine they made with their own hands, and the result of these negotiations gives way to many assumptions, expectations and imaginations</span></p>

         <p>The applications of artificial intelligence and its fields are expanding to include many aspects of our lives, and there is no doubt that each of us has dealt with artificial intelligence techniques in one way or another during our daily life. Here are some examples of the uses of this technology in our lives.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>1- Artificial Intelligence in Marketing Marketing is an effective way to beautify products in order to attract more customers. We humans are really good at beautifying and marketing our products, but what if there was an algorithm (computer program) or a machine that was made for the purpose of marketing only?! He will do a great job without a doubt. Let's think together, a few years ago finding a product on an e-commerce site without knowing its exact name was a real nightmare, almost impossible task. But today, as soon as we search for a specific product, e-commerce sites will show us all other similar goods, it is as if search engines are reading our thoughts, and in just a few seconds you can find information and products that would have taken days and weeks in the past to find them. One of the important practical applications of using artificial intelligence in marketing is what we see on the famous Netflix website. Do you know why so many people love this site? They find it very easy to find a suitable movie for them? The reason is that Netflix uses high-accuracy predictive technology, which is based on the viewer's behavior and reaction to the movies he watches or chooses, and then suggests programs that match your previous choices.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>2- Artificial Intelligence in Banking Artificial intelligence in banking is witnessing rapid growth beyond expectations, as many banks have already adopted AI-based systems to provide customer support, anomalies and credit card fraud. Like HDFC Bank in India. HDFC Bank has developed an AI-based chatbot called EVA (Electronic Virtual Assistant), and since its launch, Eva has processed more than 3 million customer inquiries, interacted with over half a million and conducted over a million conversations. Eva can gather information from thousands of sources and provide simple answers in less than half a second! AI is also used to prevent fraud by tracking the use of bank cards and analyzing the behavior of bank transactions to identify fraud attempts, which is what major companies such as MasterCard do.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;</p>
         <p>3- Artificial intelligence in health care Many organizations and medical care centers rely on artificial intelligence to treat patients and save millions of lives. There are many examples of this: Cambio Health Care has developed a Clinical Stroke Prevention Support System that sends warning alerts when a patient is at risk of a heart attack. Also, Coala Life has developed a smart digital device that can detect heart disease. Aifloo is developing a system to track the performance of people in nursing homes and home care and help them go about their activities and routines. Perhaps the best thing about using AI technologies in health care is that there is no need to develop any new medicines, but rather using the medicines that already exist in a smart and correct way that saves lives.</p>
